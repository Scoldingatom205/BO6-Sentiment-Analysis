# Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Sentiment & Topic Analysis – Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of player feedback during the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (BO6) beta, focusing on sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Through the collection of over 6,000 reviews, comments, and posts from Reddit and Steam, we examined players' most pressing concerns and overall sentiment toward the game across two beta weekends: August 30 – September 4, 2024 (Beta Weekend One) and September 6 – September 9, 2024 (Beta Weekend Two).

### Business Question:
How can Treyarch, the game developer, use player feedback to improve the game ahead of launch? What key areas should they focus on to address player concerns to ensure player satisfaction and engagement?

## Dataset Structure
We collected and analyzed over 6,000 player reviews, comments, and posts from Reddit and Steam. The data included:

- **Reddit:** Over 5000 posts and comments provided by players.
- **Steam:** Over 6,000 user reviews for the BO6 beta version

## Insights Summary
The analysis focused on two primary KPIs:
- **Sentiment Score:** How players feel about the game overall (positive, negative).
- **Topic Distribution:** Identifying key topics of discussion to prioritize development efforts.

#### 1. Sentiment Analysis:
**Positive vs. Negative Reactions:**
- Players were generally positive, with Beta Weekend Two seeing a 2% increase in positive sentiment compared to Beta Weekend One, despite having fewer playable days.
- Server Stability and Weapon Balancing emerged as the most negatively discussed topics, particularly during Beta Weekend One.

#### 2. Topic Modeling:
Using BERTopic, we identified and categorized the top topics mentioned in both Reddit posts and Steam reviews. These topics reflect the most pressing concerns and highlights for players:

- **Gameplay Experience:** Players praised the overall mechanics and fluidity of BO6, with positive feedback around movement and responsiveness.
- **Weapon Balancing:** Discussions around weapon power and balance were heavily debated, with several users calling for minor tweaks before launch.
- **Map Design:** The new maps were well-received, though a few players voiced concerns over spawn points and map size for certain game modes.
- **Server Performance:** This was the most common area of negative feedback during Weekend 1 but saw a significant improvement following the 9/8 patch.
- **Game/Engine Features:** Players expressed curiosity and excitement over new features but also flagged bugs and inconsistencies, especially in Warzone 2 integration.

## Key Findings:
Game/Engine Features: Highly discussed, especially after the September 8 Patch, which introduced improvements to server stability and new maps.
Weapon Balancing: Players felt that certain weapons were either too powerful or too weak, driving significant negative sentiment.
Map Design: Players highlighted the need for balance between large and small maps, affecting visibility and playstyle variety.

## Recommendations:
1. Focus on Server Performance:

Server-related issues were the most negatively received, especially during the first beta weekend. Stabilizing servers and improving matchmaking are critical to improving player sentiment.
2. Address Weapon Balancing:

Weapon balancing remains a key concern for players. Treyarch should prioritize balancing patches for overpowered weapons to ensure fair gameplay.
3. Leverage Positive Sentiment from New Maps:

Map design received positive feedback after new maps were introduced. Focus on creating more diverse maps to keep the player base engaged.
4. Monitor Feedback in Real Time:

Continue tracking player sentiment post-launch to respond quickly to emerging issues, such as server stability and gameplay balancing, ensuring continued engagement and satisfaction.
