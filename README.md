# Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Sentiment & Topic Analysis – Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of player feedback during the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (BO6) beta, focusing on sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Through the collection of over 6,000 reviews, comments, and posts from Reddit and Steam, we examined players' most pressing concerns and overall sentiment toward the game across two beta weekends: August 30 – September 4, 2024 (Beta Weekend One) and September 6 – September 9, 2024 (Beta Weekend Two).

### Business Question:
How can Treyarch, the game developer, use player feedback to improve the game ahead of launch? What key areas should they focus on to address player concerns to ensure player satisfaction and engagement?

## Key Insights Summary
The analysis focused on two primary KPIs:
- **Sentiment Analysis:** How players feel about the game overall (positive, negative).
- **Topic Modeling:** Identifying key topics of discussion to prioritize development efforts.

#### 1. Sentiment Analysis:
**Positive vs. Negative Reactions:**
- Players were generally positive, with Beta Weekend Two seeing a 2% increase in positive sentiment compared to Beta Weekend One, despite having fewer playable days.
- Server Stability and Weapon Balancing emerged as the most negatively discussed topics, particularly during Beta Weekend One.

#### 2. Topic Modeling:
Using BERTopic, we identified and categorized the top topics mentioned in both Reddit posts and Steam reviews. These topics reflect the most pressing concerns and highlights for players:

- **Gameplay Experience:** Players praised the overall mechanics and fluidity of BO6, especially the fast-paced movement and high-kill environment. However, there was some pushback on time-to-kill (TTK) and concerns about the intensity of the sliding/nose-diving mechanics.
- **Weapon Balancing:** Discussions around weapon balance focused on the Jackal, AMES, AK-47, and C9, with many players calling for adjustments before launch.
- **Map Design:** Feedback was generally positive, though players voiced concerns over spawn points, map size, and unbalanced power positions in some modes.
- **Server Performance:** A major area of negative feedback for both weekends, but significant improvements were noted following the 9/8 patch.
- **Game/Engine Features:** The new COD HQ feature was criticized for making gameplay difficult. Additionally, players discussed the winner circle, final killcams, and the Body Shield, with mixed reviews on these features.

### Importance for Treyarch, Activision
This analysis offers actionable insights that are crucial for Treyarch and Activision in optimizing the game and ensuring a successful launch. Key benefits include:

- **Enhancing Player Satisfaction and Retention:** By addressing issues with server performance, weapon balancing, and gameplay mechanics before launch, Treyarch can boost player satisfaction, encouraging long-term engagement and player retention.
- **Prioritizing Development Resources:** The analysis identifies the most critical areas for improvement, helping Treyarch allocate resources effectively. By focusing on gameplay, map design, and server performance, they can minimize post-launch fixes and enhance the overall player experience.
- **Boosting Launch Success and Managing Expectations:** The sentiment and topic analysis provides early warning signs for potential issues, allowing Treyarch to proactively address them before launch. Clear communication of fixes will help build community trust and set realistic player expectations.
- **Driving Community Engagement and Loyalty:** Quick responses to beta feedback, as demonstrated by the 9/8 patch, foster community loyalty. Maintaining this level of engagement will enhance player satisfaction and encourage positive word-of-mouth marketing.
- **Informed Business Decisions for Activision:** The insights gained from player feedback extend beyond gameplay, informing monetization strategies such as DLC, battle passes, and in-game purchases. Understanding player sentiment helps Activision align its in-game economy with what players want, improving revenue streams.
- **Gaining a Competitive Advantage:** The FPS market is highly competitive, and by leveraging real-time feedback to deliver a more polished, player-focused experience, Treyarch and Activision can stand out against competitors. Addressing key concerns early enhances their competitive edge and builds a more loyal player base.
