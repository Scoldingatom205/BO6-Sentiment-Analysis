# Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Sentiment & Topic Analysis – Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of player feedback during the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (BO6) beta, focusing on sentiment analysis and topic modeling. Through the collection of over 6,000 reviews, comments, and posts from Reddit and Steam, we examined players' most pressing concerns and overall sentiment toward the game across two beta weekends: August 30 – September 4, 2024 (Beta Weekend One) and September 6 – September 9, 2024 (Beta Weekend Two).

### Business Question:
How can Treyarch, the game developer, use player feedback to improve the game ahead of launch? What key areas should they focus on to address player concerns to ensure player satisfaction and engagement?

## Insights Summary
The analysis focused on two primary KPIs:
- **Sentiment Score:** How players feel about the game overall (positive, negative).
- **Topic Distribution:** Identifying key topics of discussion to prioritize development efforts.

#### 1. Sentiment Analysis:
**Positive vs. Negative Reactions:**
- Players were generally positive, with Beta Weekend Two seeing a 2% increase in positive sentiment compared to Beta Weekend One, despite having fewer playable days.
- Server Stability and Weapon Balancing emerged as the most negatively discussed topics, particularly during Beta Weekend One.

#### 2. Topic Modeling:
Using BERTopic, we identified and categorized the top topics mentioned in both Reddit posts and Steam reviews. These topics reflect the most pressing concerns and highlights for players:

- **Gameplay Experience:** Players praised the overall mechanics and fluidity of BO6, with positive feedback around the innovative omnimovement. There is minor pushback on the time-to-kill with players hoping it would increase a touch. 
- **Weapon Balancing:** Discussions around weapon power and balance were heavily debated, with players calling for adjustements to be made on the Jackal, AMES, AK-47 and C9 before launch.
- **Map Design:** The new maps was mostly well-received. There were concerns over spawn points, the small map size and how it applies to certain game modes, and the 'power positioning' of certain sides of the map that were more favorable and difficult to overcome.
- **Server Performance:** This was the most common area of negative feedback during Weekend 1 but saw a significant improvement on the latter half of the each beta weekend.
- **Game/Engine Features:** There was a lot of criticm regarding the new COD HQ feature which had made it diffult for players to even play. Players talked about the winnder circle, final killcams, and there were mixed reviews regarding the Body Shield.

## Key Findings:
Game/Engine Features: Highly discussed, especially after the September 8 Patch, which introduced improvements to server stability and new maps.
Weapon Balancing: Players felt that certain weapons were either too powerful or too weak, driving significant negative sentiment.
Map Design: Players highlighted the need for balance between large and small maps, affecting visibility and playstyle variety.

## Recommendations:
1. Focus on Server Performance:

Server-related issues were the most negatively received, especially during the first beta weekend. Stabilizing servers and improving matchmaking are critical to improving player sentiment.
2. Address Weapon Balancing:

Weapon balancing remains a key concern for players. Treyarch should prioritize balancing patches for overpowered weapons to ensure fair gameplay.
3. Leverage Positive Sentiment from New Maps:

Map design received positive feedback after new maps were introduced. Focus on creating more diverse maps to keep the player base engaged.
4. Monitor Feedback in Real Time:

Continue tracking player sentiment post-launch to respond quickly to emerging issues, such as server stability and gameplay balancing, ensuring continued engagement and satisfaction.

### Importance for Treyarch, Activision
This analysis is critical for ensuring the successful launch and long-term engagement of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. By addressing key player concerns from the beta phase—such as server performance, weapon balancing, and gameplay mechanics—Treyarch can enhance player satisfaction and reduce post-launch issues.

Prioritizing development efforts based on real feedback allows Treyarch to focus resources on areas that matter most, ensuring a smoother launch. For Activision, this data provides insights into player behavior and monetization opportunities, helping them optimize post-launch strategies and increase player retention.

Overall, this work positions both companies to deliver a more polished experience, improve community relations, and gain a competitive edge in the FPS market. By continuously monitoring player sentiment, Treyarch and Activision can maintain the game's momentum and ensure its long-term success.
